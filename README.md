# Angular Recipes
##### by Daniel Brad


# Description

Angular Recipes is a web application built with a Rails back end and Angular front end that allows a user to create and edit recipes, and also search for them by ingredient. I know, amazing!!!! In my last Angular app (Angular Stereo Builder), I went a little hog wild with custom directives. For this one I wanted to see what I could accomplish using almost exclusively Angular's built-in library and third party modules.


# Installation

To install:

First, fork and clone this repo.

Then from your terminal, enter:
```bash
bundle install
```

Then enter:
```bash
npm install
```

Then:
```bash
rake db:migrate
```


# Usage

The app is pretty self-explanatory. The only feature that isn't apparent is drag and drop to re-sort the ingredients and directions in their respective lists while in edit mode.
